# 🚀 **Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy using Multi-Model Approach (ML & DL)**

**📆 Project Duration:** 3 months  
👥 **Team Members:** 2  

## 📝 **Project Overview**  

This project aims to develop an advanced **retinal image classification system** to **diagnose Diabetic Retinopathy** (DR) in its early stages. By leveraging the power of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**, we have implemented a **multi-model approach** to provide accurate and reliable DR detection, helping to prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes.  

### 🛠️ **Key Technologies Used**  

🔹 **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for feature extraction  
🔹 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification  
🔹 **Ensemble Learning** for improved performance  
🔹 **Gradio Interface** for real-time diagnostic visualization

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**  

Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss if not detected early. Manual examination of retinal images is **⏳ time-consuming** and requires **👨‍⚕️ expert knowledge**. Therefore, an **automated system** is needed for early detection, allowing for quick and accurate diagnoses, leading to **timely interventions** and **better treatment outcomes**.

## ⚙️ **Features**  

✅ **CNN for Feature Extraction** – Extracts relevant features from retinal images to enhance classification accuracy.  
✅ **SVM Classification** – Classifies images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy.  
✅ **Ensemble Learning** – Combines multiple models to increase accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
✅ **Real-Time Diagnostics** – Provides a **Gradio-based UI** for users to upload images and receive **instant** diagnostic results.
